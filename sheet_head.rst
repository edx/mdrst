RST cheat sheet for Markdown fans
#################################

This cheatsheet provides a quick reference for translating
Markdown to ReStructured Text (RST) to help someone author or edit
RST files.

You can look at the `original Markdown file <md.md>`_ and the
`original RST file <rst.rst>`_ that the examples were culled from
to see the formatting as GitHub presents it.
